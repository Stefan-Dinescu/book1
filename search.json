Examinarea radiografică articulară poate fi utilizată pentru diagnosticarea şi monitorizarea unor multiple afecțiuni reumatice. Permite vizualizarea modificărilor degenerative caracteristice osteoartritei, precum şi a leziunilor structurale dezvoltate în evoluția bolilor inflamatorii articulare cronice, precum artrita reumatoidă sau spondiloartritele axiale.\nOther imaging tests include ultrasonography, MRI and CT.\n\n\n\n\nBansal, G J. 2006. “Digital Radiography.
